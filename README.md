# Cognitive Services Video Example

This shows how to take a stream given from any source that [OpenCvSharp](https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp) supports (camera, video file etc). Then it runs it against the [Cognitive Services Apis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services) using the C# SDKs.

The currently supported APIs are:

- Computer Vision API
- Emotion API
- Faces API


Please note, that there is also a service that exists that takes a whole video uploaded and analyzes it called the [Video Index](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/video-indexer/) service.

## How to use it
Clone the repository, change the API keys at the top of Program.cs and then hit F5.
